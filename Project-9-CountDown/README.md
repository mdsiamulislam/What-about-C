# Countdown Timer in C

This simple C program allows you to set a countdown timer by entering the initial time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It then counts down and displays the time on the screen, updating it every second until it reaches 0:0:0. After the countdown is complete, it prints "Time is over."


1. Enter the time in the format "hour minute second" when prompted.

2. The program will start the countdown, displaying the time on the screen.

3. Once the countdown is complete, it will print "Time is over."

## Input Validation

Please note that this program does not currently include input validation, so it's essential to enter valid non-negative values for hours, minutes, and seconds. Entering negative values may result in unexpected behavior.
